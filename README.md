# Data-Analytics-and-Financial-Strategies-Tutorial-2025
(I was the teaching assistant for this module which lasted from 2025 January to 2025 April)
## Course Outline (Weeks 1â€“9)

- **Week 1**: Introduction to Financial Data Analysis (Lecture 1)
  - Brush up on probability theory and statistics concepts
- **Week 2**: AutoRegressive Models (Lecture 2)
  - AutoRegressive models, their foundations, design, properties and the most relevant statistical methods to estimate their parameters and use them for forecasting
- **Week 3**: Other Linear Models (Lecture 3)
  - Moving Average family and combining it with the AR model to obtain the ARMA models. We also begin breaking the stationarity assumption, introducing integrated time series, methods to detect non-stationarity and data pre-processing techniques that help treating more complex datasets
- **Week 4**: The GARCH (Lecture 4)
  - linear dynamic volatility models: ARCH and GARCH models
- **Week 5**: Extreme Risks (Lecture 5)
  - Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall measures and how to estimate them using estimate them from data using the GARCH, Extreme Value Theory and quantile estimation
- **Week 6**: Portfolio Optimization I (Lecture 6)
  - Efficient Market Hypothesis, the Modern Portfolio Theory framework
- **Week 7**: Portfolio Optimization II (Lecture 7)
  - Farma French factor models and Principal Components Analysis
- **Week 8**: Portfolio Optimization III (Lecture 8)
  - Portfolio optimization with the Black-Litterman approach
- **Week 9**: AI-driven Strategies (Lecture 9)
  - Introduce AI and Machine Learning methods to analyse large quantities of data, focus on Feed-Forward Neural Networks: their main features and components, the typical process to design, fit and evaluate a neural network model and some simple trading strategies that can be designed using these tools.
